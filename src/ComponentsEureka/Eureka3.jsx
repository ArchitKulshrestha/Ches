        solution:"In any industry success or failure of the company depends upon 4 M’s i.e. Materials, Men, Machine and Method. Today is the age of competition and an indutry cannot survive without satisfaction of its customers. Quality of material is to be maintained in order to stand in the competitive market. To be a perfect engineer, one must be familiar with individual experience in industrial environment. He must be aware of basic industrial problems and their remedies. Here we take a industrial problem whose objective is, “Study the Amine Network of Refinery and Identify the Various Sources Of Losses & Develop Model For Tracking and Reduction of Losses”. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the various parameters on the Amine loss. ASPEN HYSYS is used to simulate this case studies. In this problem many design criteria (MDEA concentration, Temperature, amine solution flow rate etc) will be studied. The composition and operating conditions of pressure and temperature of LPG to be treated and amine will be taken from Unsat. Merox unit."

The LAB plant, which producing LAB is divided into two parts - Front End and the Back End, which extracts Normal Paraffin from Kerosene feed and NP is further dehydrogenated to linear olefins, which are then alkylated with benzene to form LAB, respectively. Our project aims to check the adequacy of the Normal Paraffin prefractionation section column for performing Debottlenecking by preparing a simulation model to simulate the distillation columns. We will know about the properties of products formed from various reactions related to LAB formation. In this project, we are using Aspen Hysys software for simulation.

However once used, they need special attention as if they are disposed off without treatment, they cause serious pollution problems. We found re-refining of waste lubricating oil by solvent extraction as one of the potential techniques. Different solvents were tested with oil samples. Three extracting solvents MEK ((Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone), 1-butanol, 2-propanol were Determined experimentally for their performance based on the parameters i.e. solvent type, solvent Oil ratio and extraction temperature Resulting mixtures were tested analytically using analytical technique. By comparing the used and treated samples, we found the best solvent, one which will be most efficient."

        solution:"Abstract: Filter run length is basically the sum of the time the filter is producing water between backwashes. Backwashing refers to pumping water backward through the filter media, sometimes including intermittent use of compressed air during the process. It is a form of preventive maintenance so that the filter media can be reused. We will try to improve the filter run length by studying various factors affecting it which can lead to increase in efficiency of filter."

        solution:"Water is one of the necessities for living and yet is the most misused commodity by humans. In a nation of excessive population growth, water scarcity but remains a challenge to be resolved. In search of new sources of water supply, air-gap distillation desalination of brackish water is increasingly being recognised as a viable option. But turning salt into freshwater takes more energy and money than is often worthwhile. In off-grid arid areas, the lack of freshwater often coincides with an abundance of solar insolation. Coupling high energy-intensive operations of desalination systems with renewable energy sources is a feasible alternative for achieving a carbon-neutral economy. Improvising desalination system with the heat recovery method will act as closed-loop feedback aiding in preheating the feedwater along with evaporation and thereby increasing the efficiency of the system."

Processing time, energy-saving, product shelf life, quality and safety of food have improved a lot in all these years and have encouraged many food manufacturers to further use this. But certain factors resist it's usage among many, be it in terms of its cost or efficiency. Some major limitations are the high initial investment in equipment, uneven cooling in some leafy vegetables and weight loss due to moisture loss. Loss of water vapour affects the food quality factors such as texture, colour and perceived product characteristics. We will try to mitigate the weight loss in food items kept in vacuum cooling system, so that food quality can be preserved efficiently."

Both carbon dioxide and methane (the major components of natural gas) are known as greenhouse gases associated with concerns about global warming.Using flare gas recovery system we can reduce the flare gas emissions which mainly consists of natural gas & also cost of natural gas can be reduced. Since the inception of flaring, technology advancements have made flare system more environment-friendly. These include: (1) reducing the fuel consumption of flare pilots, (2) implementing purge reduction devices to reduce the amount of supplemental fuel gas burned (3) using steam more efficiently to achieve smokeless flaring (4)the automatic ignition system and (5)installing flare gas recovery systems to reduce the amount of gas flared. Our aim is to make flare system more environment-friendly, safe and efficient using flare gas recovery system by preparing a simulation model in Aspen Hysys."

As we have come to know of that fluid operations are of very deep interest to chemical engineering, we will focus on gas related operations, especially compression. Gas compression is a broad topic, since it's subtopics are categorized keeping in mind the various various applications required, different gases (pure or mixture) to be involved in the proceedings and many other parameters. Our Team will carry out research revolving around the basic idea of Gas Compression and try to optimize the existing processes studying and taking various factors such as Pressure, Temperature ,flow rate and other environment variables into consideration. Our main goal is to optimize the process of gas compression and at the same time make it as environment friendly as possible. We will study the Numerical Methods involved in the fluid flow and compression. To simulate the process which we will design and optimze we will be learning and try to apply our research using various softwares such as - ASPEN/DWSIM MATLAB(Simscape , Guide) NUMECA FINE / Turbo AFT Fathom and any other suitable software which will help us along our journey. Our research will also focus on the already available and industrially used resources involving fluid compressors trying to derive a different for their usage. We will be going through different case studies for the same, try to correlate them with the existing ones, and even try to optimize them with whatever knowledge we gained. Also, we will study the hazards this technology has brought upon the man and industry alike all during its existence, try to find out as to why did they even occur, and the probable solutions to these tragic occurences."

        solution:"Consequences of Carbon, Energy & the Environment clash has always been an alarming issue for coal based power generation. CO2 emission and its affects on global climate is of great concern to us. It constrains us to use the coal to generate clean energy. Coal Gasification is one such approach that converts solid coal into mixture of Carbon Monoxide & Hydrogen rich gases, known as synthesis gas (Syn gas), with limited amount of Oxygen. In layman terms, coal gasification is the incomplete combustion of coal. H2S(g) & NH3(g) by-products formed are of great importance, which makes coal gasification favourable for environment and economically efficient over conventional coal combustion with dangerous and difficult to treat SO2 & NOx as by-products. Our main purpose through this project is to maximize the production of Syn gas by Coal gasification while keeping cost of production and known & unknown losses in check which will further be used for the preparation of methanol."
